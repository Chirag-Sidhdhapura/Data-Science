Deep learning is an AI function that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions. Deep learning AI is able to learn without human supervision, drawing from data that is both unstructured and unlabeled.

we can implement deep learning using neural networks.
various types of neural networks are :
1.Artificial Neural Networks
2.Convulational Neural Networks
3.Recurrent Neural Networks
